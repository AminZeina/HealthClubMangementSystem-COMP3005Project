# HealthClubMangementSystem-COMP3005Project

This repo contains the DB design and implementation for a Health Club Management system, based on the requirements given in the COMP 3005 Final Project outline.

The DDL and SQL commands are in respectively named .sql files within this repo. These statments were written for PostgreSQL, in the PostgreSQL dialect. 

To use this DB design, simply run the the commands found in `DDL_commands.sql` in your DB Management system or application of choice. For additional functionality, also run the commands found in triggers.sql.

To test this implementation, run the commands found in `SQL_commands.sql`; these commands provide a sample of the core features supported by this DB design.
